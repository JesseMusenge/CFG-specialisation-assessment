Collections library

1.2:
The first difference is in connectedness and cycles. Trees do not contain any cycles (loops) 
whereas Graphs can have cycles (cyclic graphs) or not (acyclic graphs). Also, in a tree there is a unique path 
between any two nodes and so it is connected, meaning there is a path between any two nodes in the tree. 
However, a graph can also have disconnected components (sets of nodes that are not connected to each other). 
Secondly, a tree has a single root node that serves as the starting point, whereas graphs do not have 
a concept of a single root node.

Time complexity is the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its execution as a function of the input size. 
It’s a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm grows with increasing input. It is expressed using Big O notation, 
which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's runtime. 
For example, O(1) is constant time complexity, which means the algorithm's runtime does not depend on the input size.

Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses to complete its execution as a function of the input size. 
It represents the maximum amount of memory required by an algorithm during its execution. 
Similar to time complexity is also expressed using the Big O notation. 
For example, O(1) is constant space complexity, which represents how the algorithm uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of the input size.

1.4
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, 
and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, 
which is when the list is now sorted.

At the end of each pass, the largest (or smallest, depending on the sorting order) element gets placed in its 
correct position. This guarantees that after the first pass, the largest element will be in the last position of the list. 

Bubble Sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), where 'n' is the number of elements in the list. 
This makes it inefficient for large lists, as its quadratic time complexity results in a lot of comparisons and swaps. 
In terms of space complexity, Bubble Sort requires O(1) extra space since it performs comparisons and swaps in 
lace without requiring additional data structures. 

1.5
LIFO and FIFO refer to ways we can manage data within data structures, specifically in the context of stacks and queues.

LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) is a principle where the last element added to a data structure is the first one to be removed. 
It's analogous to a stack of items where you place new items on top, and when you need to remove an item, you take the 
one from the top. The most recently added element is the one that is accessed next. LIFO can be applied to lists in python. 
The append() method is used to add elements to the end of the list (push operation), and the pop() method without any 
index specified is used to remove and return the last element (pop operation).

FIFO (First-In, First-Out) is where the first element added to a data structure is the first one to be removed. 
It's similar to a queue where you can add items to the back of the queue and remove items from the front. 
The oldest element is the one that is accessed next. In practice, the deque data structure from the collections module 
is commonly used to implement a FIFO structure. The append() method is used to enqueue (add) elements to the end of the 
deque, and the popleft() method is used to dequeue (remove and return) elements from the front of the deque.

1.6
A Balanced Binary Tree is a type of binary tree data structure that follows three conditions. Firstly, the height of 
the left and right tree for any node does not differ by more than 1.Secondly, The left subtree of that node is also 
balanced. Finally, the right subtree of that node is also balanced. A single node is always balanced. This means the 
tree is structured so that it remains balanced and doesn't become skewed towards one side, helping to maintain efficient 
operations like searching, insertion, and deletion.

The best root for a balanced binary tree depends on the use case and the data being stored. 
In an ideal balanced binary tree, the root would be chosen such that it provides roughly equal numbers of nodes in its 
left and right subtrees, ensuring that the tree remains balanced during operations.

Below presents an example of a balanced binary tree:

     10
    /    \
   5     15
  / \    / \
 3   7  13  18

If we were to search for the value 13 in this tree:
We would start at the root node, which is 10.
We compare 12 with the value of the root (10). Since 13 is greater than 10, we move to the right subtree.
This brings us to the node with the value 15. Next we compare 13 with 15. Since 13 is less than 15, we move to 
the left subtree.Finally, this brings us to the node with the value 13. We found the value we were looking for.

The search process in a balanced binary tree is efficient because at each step, we are able to eliminate half of the 
remaining nodes due to the balanced structure of the tree. This makes the search operation have a time complexity of 
O(log n), where 'n' is the number of nodes in the tree.
